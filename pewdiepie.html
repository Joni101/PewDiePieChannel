                    <p>PewDiePie was born Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg and raised in Gothenburg, Sweden.</p>
                    <p> He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (born 7 May 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 8 January 1957), and grew up with his sister, Fanny, as well. His mother Johanna, a former KappAhl CIO, was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden. His father, Ulf, is also a Chief Executive of a company.</p>
                    <p> In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in Industrial Economics and Technology Management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011 to focus on his YouTube career. On this decision, PewDiePie has stated, "Thinking about it now, it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for industrial economics you need straight A's, but somehow I was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos."</p>

                        <strong>PewDiePie and video games</strong>

                    <hr>
                </div>
                <hr>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his early years as a YouTube personality, PewDiePie was known for playing horror and action video games, most notably Amnesia: The Dark Descent and its related mods. PewDiePie also began posting weekly vlogs starting from 2 September 2011. He typically performs a "Brofist" at the end of each of his videos. In 2014, the gamer began to more actively play games that interested him, regardless if they were of the horror genre or not. In addition, he is also known to support video games from indie developers.</p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nature of PewDiePie's video content has been described by various outlets as goofy, energetic, obnoxious and filled with profanity. However, many of the same outlets concede that PewDiePie's content is genuine and unfiltered. Sarah Begley of Time said his clips contained "charismatic narration." Chris Reed of The Wall St. Cheat Sheet said it contained "off-the-cuff running commentary that's characterised by goofy jokes, profanity, and loud outbursts." Another reporter noted PewDiePie's "chosen mode of sharing his critique happens to be ribald entertainment, an unmediated stream of blurted jokes, startled yelps, goofy voices, politically incorrect comments, and pretty much nonstop profanity." Reed adds that these aspects of PewDiePie's videos are what critics find most abrasive, but what fans love the most.</p>

                        <strong>Becoming a YouTube star</strong>
                    </h2>
					<hr>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PewDiePie originally registered a YouTube account under the name "Pewdie"; he gamer explains that "pew" represents the sound of lasers and "die" means death. After forgetting the password to this account, he then registered the "PewDiePie" YouTube channel on 29 April 2010. After dropping out of Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result PewDiePie funded his early videos by working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [that] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. it was just something I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012 the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September 2012. In October 2012, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel. That December, PewDiePie signed with Maker Studios. </p>
					
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On 18 February 2013, the PewDiePie channel reached 5 million subscribers, and in April, PewDiePie earned coverage on The New York Times after surpassing 6 million subscribers. In May, at the inaugural Starcount Social Stars Awards in Singapore PewDiePie won the award for Swedish Social Star. Competing against Jenna Marbles, Smosh and Toby Turner, PewDiePie also won the award for Most Popular Social Show. In July 2013, he overtook Jenna Marbles to become the second most subscribed YouTube user, and reached 10 million subscribers. </p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PewDiePie's subscriber count surpassed that of the leading channel, Smosh, on 15 August 2013. On becoming the most subscribed YouTube user, PewDiePie commented, "When I started my YouTube channel in 2010, I never imagined that one day it would be the most subscribed channel in the world and that I would be a part of such a great community." After becoming the most subscribed user, Ben Donovan of Maker Studios stated that PewDiePie "is a great example of how a YouTube content creator can amass a worldwide following due to passion and creativity, and his large subscriber base showcases the loyalty and strong connection he has to his 'bros.'" On 1 November, PewDiePie became the first channel to reach 15 million subscribers, although the following day, the channel was surpassed by YouTube's Spotlight account at the top of the site's subscriber rankings. In the same month, PewDiePie proclaimed his dislike of YouTube's new comment system. In December, PewDiePie overtook the YouTube Spotlight channel to once again become the most subscribed user on YouTube.</p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout 2012 and 2013, PewDiePie's channel was one of the fastest growing on YouTube, in terms of subscribers gained. In 2013, the PewDiePie channel went from 3.5 million to just under 19 million subscribers and by the end of 2013 it was gaining a new subscriber every 1.037 seconds. Billboard reported that the PewDiePie channel gained more subscribers than any other channel in 2013. Additionally, in the second half of 2013, the PewDiePie channel earned just under 1.3 billion video views. </p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In March 2014, PewDiePie updated his video production, announcing he would be scaling down the frequency of uploads. In August 2014, Maker Studios released an official PewDiePie app for the iPhone, allowing audiences to view the gamer's videos, create custom favourite video feeds and share videos with others. Later in the month, PewDiePie uploaded a video, announcing he would permanently disable comments on his YouTube videos. On his decision, PewDiePie stated "I go to the comments and it's mainly spam, it's people self advertising, it's people trying to provoke... just all this stuff that to me, it doesn't mean anything. I don't care about it, I don't want to see it." After disabling comments, PewDiePie continued interacting with his audience through Twitter and Reddit. In mid-September, PewDiePie uploaded a follow-up video, sticking by his decision, and announcing the launch of broarmy.net, an online forum, in which he will actively connect with his viewers, designed to replace the YouTube comment section.</p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September, PewDiePie began streaming videos of his co-hosted series, BroKen, onto MLG.tv. Kjellberg co-hosts the series with Kenneth Morrison, better known as CinnamonToastKen, also an online game commentator. On 13 October, PewDiePie decided to allow comments on his videos once more, albeit only after approval. However, PewDiePie has tweeted, "I have them set as approved so I can redirect people to comment on my website instead." In a later video, PewDiePie claimed that disabling comments helped him become happier. In 2014 alone, PewDiePie's account amassed nearly 14 million new subscribers and over 4.1 billion video views; both figures were higher than any other user. </p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During July 2015, PewDiePie's videos were documented to receive over 300 million views per month. On 6 September 2015, PewDiePie's YouTube account became the first to eclipse 10 billion video views. </p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In September, PewDiePie hinted that he would have a role in series, and that he was on location in Los Angeles for the show's shooting. Although not many details were revealed at the time, in October, it was announced that the series would be titled Scare PewDiePie. The series is set to be released in 2016 through YouTube's paid subscription service, YouTube Red. </p>
					<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past three months, the 25-year-old YouTuber has scored a lengthy profile in ESPN and the cover of Variety. He’s written a book for teens that is already among Amazon.com’s most popular — a full month before its release. And on Sunday, he added a new record to his résumé: He’s the first person to ever reach 10 billion YouTube views.</p>
